  about_markdown: >-
    Jeremy Bowers, CEO & Team Leader of KW Philly, entrepreneurial spirit dates
    back to his childhood in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. After graduating from
    Penn State University, Jeremy began his career in real estate in 2003.
    Jeremy quickly excelled in real estate sales and lead one of the top
    producing teams in the greater Philadelphia area early in his career.
    Naturally, Jeremy advanced to a leadership role and became the Manager of a
    local franchise, which was recognized as the Top 10 franchise for growth in
    the United States, at the time. Jeremy eventually started his own real
    estate investment company in Philadelphia; however, the lack of human
    interaction and ability to help others drove Jeremy to seek different
    opportunities. In 2018, Jeremy was named the CEO & Team Leader of KW Philly,
    the fastest growing brokerage in the United States. Jeremy has lead KW
    Philly to attain the \#1 market share in Philadelphia. Jeremy is a true
    visionaire; his innovative techniques, systems, and models have been proven
    effective over the years by thousands of agents. By focusing on culture,
    Jeremy has succeeded in creating a dynamic and versatile environment at KW
    Philly. With his extensive knowledge and commitment to providing only the
    best and most timely information to his agents, Jeremy Bowers is your go-to
    source for real estate industry insight and advice.
