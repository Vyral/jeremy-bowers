        <title>Being Part Time VS. Full Time</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQvFuMul4Zo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between being a part time agent, versus being a full time agent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the real estate business, many people choose to do it part time. The most effective way to be successful as a part time agent is to pretend as though it’s an hourly job. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started as a part time agent, I would block off certain nights of the week, for four hour time-blocks. I would focus on lead generation, marketing, or showing houses.  It allowed me to accelerate really quickly, but many people don’t follow that path. If you don’t time block and map out your goals, you won’t see success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re thinking about going full time, you need to align yourself with a brokerage that will support you in your endeavor. To learn more, watch this short video.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Should I Join a Team?</title>
        <description>&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMqE1x9iE0s?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often get the question, “Should I join a team or not?”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer depends on what you want. There are plenty of benefits to joining a team, just as there are benefits with staying independent. There’s no right or wrong answer, but to help you determine what is right for you, watch this short video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What should you be looking for when you’re thinking about aligning yourself with a brokerage? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It depends entirely on your situation, and there are three questions you can ask to determine the answer. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What do you want?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;How are you going to get there?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;What is your why?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
