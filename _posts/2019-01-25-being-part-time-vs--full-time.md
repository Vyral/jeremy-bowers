What's the difference between being a part time agent, versus being a full time agent?

In the real estate business, many people choose to do it part time. The most effective way to be successful as a part time agent is to pretend as though it's an hourly job.&nbsp;

I would focus on lead generation, marketing, or showing houses. &nbsp;It allowed me to accelerate really quickly, but many people don't follow that path. If you don't time block and map out your goals, you won't see success.&nbsp;

If you're thinking about going full time, you need to align yourself with a brokerage that will support you in your endeavor. To learn more, watch this short video.
