<p style="text-align: center;"><em>If you want to grow, whether personally or professionally, there are four stages you need to go through first. Let’s discuss.</em></p>

There are four stages of growth every successful agent will go through during their career, so today we’ll shed some light on each. Before I cover the importance of growth, in general, let’s go over what all of these stages are.&nbsp;

First, imagine a pyramid. The base of this pyramid is made up of the first stage: “think.” The next level on the pyramid is the second stage: “earn.” The third stage (and the next level up on the pyramid) is “net,” and the final stage (and the peak of the pyramid) is “receive.”&nbsp;

**With all of that said, it’s important to realize that these steps don’t come naturally.** You have to be proactive to grow in your business and your life. You also need to help other people grow to do so, yourself. After all, there’s no such thing as being a successful agent without having successful relationships. The more you give to people, the more you’ll receive from them in return.&nbsp;

This holds true in all aspects of life. Whatever it is you’re working toward, whether it be personal growth or professional growth, following the steps outlined in the pyramid model I mentioned earlier will guide you to success.

**If you would like to learn more about how you can harness these ideas yourself, please reach out to me.** I love connecting with my fellow agents, whether you’re new to the industry or are an experienced real estate professional, as well as with individuals who aren’t yet in real estate but are unhappy with their current career. It would be my pleasure to further explain the concepts from this message to you in person, through a phone call, or by email.&nbsp;

If you have any other questions or would like more information, feel free to get in touch. I look forward to connecting with you soon.
