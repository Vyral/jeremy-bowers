As a real estate agent, what’s the difference between renting and owning your business? Why should you strive to own your business instead of rent it?

To answer the first question, renting a business is the more traditional industry model. You typically start by owning 50% of the business and build your way up to owning 90%. However, you’re still paying rent in the form of a franchise fee. Basically, it’s like renting an apartment—**you never technically own it, and you’re never at a point where you’re earning equity.**

When you own a business, you get set at a certain percentage and pay a firm fee, but you make 100% of the profit. You might start off making 70%, but you’d eventually end up at 100%. By owning your business, you also no longer have to pay a franchise fee. Here at KW Philly, you’d pay a 6% firm fee, but that’s capped at $3,000.

When you rent a business, a traditional firm will take 20% of your revenue. If you generated $300,000 a year, for instance, your firm would take $60,000. On top of that, you're looking at paying a franchise fee of $18,000, so in total, you’re paying $78,000 of that $300,000. If you owned your business, you’d only pay $28,000 of that total.

When you rent things in life, you normally get tax write-offs and other benefits from doing so. **By owning your business, though, you can help make it grow and make more money by referring people to your firm**. I know people who make as much as $30,000 or $40,000 a month through referral fees.

Besides owning your business versus renting your business, there’s another option you should consider: Investing. Is anyone at your firm helping you invest in real estate? Do you have an opportunity to invest in other projects or buy a rental property? I recommend investing in at least one rental property per year. Are you around the type of people who will help you do this?

As real estate agents, we sometimes focus too much on being an agent and not enough on being a business owner. A business owner looks at multiple revenue streams that can benefit themselves as well as their clients. They also consider whether those revenue streams will impact the next generation. I refer to this as “generational disruption,” and when you own your business, you can achieve this.

When you rent your business, however, you trade time for money, and **when you trade time for money, eventually everything stops.**

If you’re tired of renting your business and you want to become an owner, I’d love to show you all the ways you can accomplish this. I’ve helped people generate millions of dollars in the investment game, and billions of dollars in the real estate game. Now, I’m helping people generate retirement income through their downlines.

Just give me a call or send me an email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
